Notes:
========
The results are contained in an XML document, which you can examine directly by clicking on the link above.
The document contains two parts. The first part is the responseHeader, which contains information about
the response itself. The main part of the reply is in the result tag, which contains one or more doc tags, each
of which contains fields from documents that match the query.

If you don’t specify which fields you want, all of them are returned.
